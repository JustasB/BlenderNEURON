BlenderNEURON is a software tool that enables to use Blender, an open-source high-performance 3D modeling tool to
visualize and edit models built with NEURON simulator. 

********
Features
********

 - NEURON models can be in any format (HOC or Python)
 - Cell/Network morphology inspection
 - Membrane potential (or any other membrane variable) visualization over time
 - Replay, step-through, scrubbing through simulation output
 - Adjustable level of detail (supports single cell or large network models)
 - Render as static images or video files
 - Blender files can be uploaded and shared on `Sketchfab <https://Sketchfab.com>`_
 - Python API to automate any task

The tool consists of two parts: 

1) The Python library, which runs inside NEURON
2) The Blender Addon, which runs inside Blender

These two parts exchange information and allow importing/exporting models between NEURON and Blender.
